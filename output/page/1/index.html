	<li><p>This is an article. It will contain quite a bit of text. What follows
is from the anti-federalist papers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We the Aristocratic party of the United States, lamenting the many
inconvenienc ies to which the late confederation subjected the well-
born , the better kind of people, bringing them down to the level of
the rabble &#8212;and holding in utter detestation that frontispiece to
every bill of rights, &#8220;that all men are born equal &#8221;&#8212;beg leave (for
the purpose of drawing a line between such as we think were ordained
to govern, a nd such as were made to bear the weight of government
without having any share in its ad ministration) to submit to our f
riends in the first class for their inspection, the following defense
of our monarchical, aristocratical democracy .  </p>
<p>1st. As a majority of all societies consist of men who (though totally
incapable of thinking or acting in governmental matters) are more
readily led than driven, we have thought meet to indulge them in
something like a democracy in the new constitution, which part we have
de signated by the popular name of the House of Representatives. But
to guard against every possible danger from this lower house , we have
subjected every bill they bring forward, to the double negative of our
upper house and president. . . .  </p>
<p>2d. They will from th e perpetuality of office be under our eye, and
in a short time will think and act like us , independently of popular
whims and prejudices. . . . We have frequently endeavored to effect in
our respective states, the happy discrimination which pervades this
system; but finding we could not bring the states into it
individually, we have determined . . .  and have taken pains to leave
the legislature of each free and independent state, as they now call
themselves, in such a situation that they will eventually be absorb ed
by our grand continental vortex , or dwindle into petty corporations,
and have power over little else than yoa king hogs or determining the
width of cart wheels . . .  Impressed with a conviction that this
constitution is calculated to restrain the influenc e and power of the
LOWER CLASS &#8212; to draw that discrimination we have so long sought
after; to secure to our friends privileges and offices . . . </p>
