This is an article. It will contain quite a bit of text. What follows
is from the anti-federalist papers.

>We the Aristocratic party of the United States, lamenting the many
>inconvenienc ies to which the late confederation subjected the well-
>born , the better kind of people, bringing them down to the level of
>the rabble —and holding in utter detestation that frontispiece to
>every bill of rights, “that all men are born equal ”—beg leave (for
>the purpose of drawing a line between such as we think were ordained
>to govern, a nd such as were made to bear the weight of government
>without having any share in its ad ministration) to submit to our f
>riends in the first class for their inspection, the following defense
>of our monarchical, aristocratical democracy .

>1st. As a majority of all societies consist of men who (though totally
>incapable of thinking or acting in governmental matters) are more
>readily led than driven, we have thought meet to indulge them in
>something like a democracy in the new constitution, which part we have
>de signated by the popular name of the House of Representatives. But
>to guard against every possible danger from this lower house , we have

>2d. They will from th e perpetuality of office be under our eye, and
>in a short time will think and act like us , independently of popular
>whims and prejudices. . . . We have frequently endeavored to effect in
>our respective states, the happy discrimination which pervades this
>system; but finding we could not bring the states into it
>individually, we have determined . . .  and have taken pains to leave
>the legislature of each free and independent state, as they now call
>themselves, in such a situation that they will eventually be absorb ed
>by our grand continental vortex , or dwindle into petty corporations,
>and have power over little else than yoa king hogs or determining the
>width of cart wheels . . .  Impressed with a conviction that this
>constitution is calculated to restrain the influenc e and power of the
>LOWER CLASS — to draw that discrimination we have so long sought
>after; to secure to our friends privileges and offices . . .
